# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Document Storage System is a comprehensive file management feature that enables users to upload, organize, share, and collaborate on documents within the Lumen platform. Similar to Google Drive, this system will provide secure cloud storage with granular sharing permissions, folder organization, and magic link sharing capabilities. This feature will enhance the learning experience by allowing students and educators to easily manage and share educational materials, assignments, and collaborative documents.

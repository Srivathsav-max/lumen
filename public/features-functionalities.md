# Features & Functionalities

Moxium's architecture forms a holistic learning ecosystem with carefully designed features that enhance the learning experience while seamlessly integrating with our core AI architecture.

## Smart Notes

### Objective
Moxium's Smart Notes go beyond traditional note-taking by automatically synthesizing and reinforcing key concepts from learning materials using advanced natural language processing.

### Auto-Summarization with NLP
- **Transformer-Based Extraction**: We use advanced language models to extract key sentences from textbooks and lectures, weighting them by both keyword relevance and thematic alignment
- **Concept Linking**: Notes are automatically linked to knowledge graph nodes using attention mechanisms

### Spaced Repetition Scheduling
We optimize review intervals based on the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve, mastery level, and learning patterns:
- Base intervals expand exponentially as mastery increases
- Review timing accounts for individual learning rates
- The system factors in concept difficulty when scheduling reviews

## Concept Mapping & Knowledge Graphs

### Objective
One of Moxium's most powerful features is its ability to visualize and help users navigate complex interdependencies between concepts through interactive knowledge graphs.

### Dynamic Knowledge Graph Construction
- **Prerequisite Edge Detection**: We use neural networks to infer relationships between concepts
- **Community-Driven Refinement**: User feedback improves concept relationships over time

### Interactive Concept Maps
- **Personalized Pathways**: Learning gaps are visualized through color intensity
- **Navigable Interfaces**: Users can explore connections and dependencies between topics

## Interactive Learning & Practice

### Objective
Rather than passive content consumption, we engage users through adaptive, multi-modal content that responds to their learning patterns and preferences.

### Procedural Content Generation (PCG)
- **Rule-Based Variants**: Generate personalized practice problems through parameterization
- **LLM-Augmented Hints**: Provide context-aware assistance using retrieved content and user history

### Real-Time Feedback
- **Error Analysis with BKT**: Identify persistent mistakes and trigger micro-lessons when needed
- **Personalized Correction**: Tailor explanations to the specific misunderstandings exhibited

## Exam Readiness & Performance Analytics

### Objective
Beyond simple progress tracking, Moxium employs sophisticated predictive analytics to forecast exam performance and identify areas needing attention.

### Predictive Analytics
- **Survival Analysis for Exam Readiness**: Model time-to-mastery using statistical hazard models
- **IRT-Based Score Projection**: Estimate potential exam scores by aggregating predicted performance across relevant questions

### Cheat Detection
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag users with inconsistent Item Response Theory parameters
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify statistically unlikely response patterns

## Collaboration & Peer Learning

### Objective
Research shows that collaborative learning significantly enhances understanding and retention. Moxium uniquely combines social learning with personalization.

### Role-Based Group Work
- **Skill-Based Role Assignment**: Assign roles based on individual strengths using clustering algorithms
- **Complementary Team Formation**: Create balanced groups with diverse skill sets

### Shared Concept Maps
- **Merge Individual Graphs**: Create group knowledge graphs via union operations
- **Collaborative Gap Filling**: Leverage peer knowledge to address individual weaknesses

## Gamification and Engagement

### Objective
Moxium's gamification system goes beyond simple points and badges, implementing a dynamic reward system that adapts to each learner's motivational patterns and learning style.

### Dynamic Achievement System
- **Mastery-Based Badges**: Adjust badge requirements based on individual learning patterns
- **Personalized Challenges**: Create goals that balance achievability with meaningful growth

### Adaptive Point System
- **Engagement-Weighted Points**: Allocate points based on multiple performance factors using sigmoid functions
- **Streak Bonuses**: Reward consistent engagement and progressive improvement
